# Performance showcase for JS Frameworks 

In this project you can test the performance for javascript frameworks.
The state handling in each Demo ist build with
 [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) / [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable).

In the Demo you can select the size of the tree (small, medium, large).

Edit nodes by click on a single node.

The rendering of each node is simulated by css animations (only for the small tree).
So you can see whats going on.
